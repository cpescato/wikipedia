What can we learn from Wikipedia adminship elections ? 
How social network structure potentially infkuence voting in a time-dependent manner: analysis of a signed social network. 

Politics are everywhere. 
From seeking to be the class representative of your 5th grade class, to announcing you will be running for president (never say never, sometimes dreams DO come true), you are most likely to be involved in some kind of election throughout your life. 
We yet do not have the magic trick that will ensure you to be elected next time you run, but we are working hard on it. And for that, we chose to analyse past elections, exactly like football players review past games for improving their strategy. 
We chose to look back on Wikipedia Adminship elections that happened between 2004 and 2008. 
For some context : Wikipedia is the free online encyclopedia that we all know and love. Its articles are written by volunteers, amongst whom can be distinguished Administrators. In addition of being able to write articles, those people also have access to technical features of the website, especially giving the ability to help with its maintenance. But not anyone can become an admin that easily ! Adminship seekers have go through a public election process at the end of which the vote count determines whether or not they are promoted.

And now we ask : Tell us what you got Wikipedia ! 

# TEMPORAL ANALYSIS 
If you could choose the time of year your election will be held, would a move be more strategic from the other ? We definitly know people are cheerier when, for example, Santa's coming to town, but is it to the point where it could influence a vote they would cast at this time ?

notes 
- if people have more time to vote, might be most likely to be elected, so campaign for longer.
