## Wikipedia adminship elections
### Hi there!

For our class in Applied Data Analysis at EPFL, we, a group of 3 EPFL students, carried out an analysis of Wikipedia adminship elections using the SNAP dataset on the Wikipedia vote network (<https://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-Vote.html>). The exact project proposal can be found following [this repository](https://github.com/epfl-ada/ada-2020-project-milestone-p3-p3_yo-banana-boy). 

On the present repository you will find the code underlying the website resuming this project.
